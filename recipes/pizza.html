    <h2>It will make your day!</h2>
    <p>
        Pizza margherita, as the Italians call it, is a simple pizza hailing from Naples. When done right, margherita pizza features a bubbly crust, crushed San Marzano tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil, a drizzle of olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt. That is all.

    <p>This pizza is simple, fresh and a guaranteed crowd pleaser. It’s a delight to make and even better to eat. How about pizza tonight?</p>
    <h3>You will need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Pizza dough
        </li>
        <li>San Marzano Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Fresh Mozzarella balls</li>
        <li>Fresh Basil</li>
        <li>Olive  oil and Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a hurry? This pizza will work with one pound of store-bought dough as well.</li>
        <li>San Marzano tomatoes are the traditional choice for pizza margherita and yield the perfect sauce. Simply pour the whole can into a bowl and crush the tomatoes by hand before using.</li>
        <li>Ovoline mozzarella balls are my favorite for pizza margherita since they are the perfect size (about 1-inch in diameter). Larger or smaller mozzarella balls will work, too. Just tear them into smaller pieces as necessary</li>
        <li>Fresh basil is absolutely essential. Once the pizza is out of the oven, sprinkle a handful of finely sliced basil on each pizza. I like to add a few small basil leaves for accents, too. Cute!</li>
        <li>Margherita pizza is not complete without a light drizzle of extra-virgin olive oil. Be careful as you pour so you don’t accidentally overdo it.Our sauce doesn’t contain any added salt, so a light sprinkle of salt helps bring out the best flavors in this pizza.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
