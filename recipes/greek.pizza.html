    <h2>Attention: you won't stop untill it finishes</h2>
    <p>The beauty of this pizza (flavor aside) is that you can make it with mostly pantry ingredients and some cheese. You’ll have to turn on the oven for it, but trust me, it’s worth it!</p>
    <h3>You will need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Pizza Dough
        </li>
        <li>Pizza Sause</li>
        <li>Dried Oregano</li>
        <li>Part-Skim Mozzarella</li>
        <li>Roasted Red Peppers</li>
        <li>Artichoke</li>
        <li>Kalamata Olives</li>
        <li>Crumbled Feta</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>This Greek pizza starts with a base of my whole wheat pizza dough. </li>
        <li>You have a couple of options here. You can use my go-to pizza sauce recipe, which is so easy to make with basic pantry ingredients! Or, use your favorite marinara sauce, either homemade or store-bought.</li>
        <li>We’ll sprinkle some dried oregano over the sauce since it’s a staple in Greek cuisine.</li>
        <li>Part-skim mozzarella turns more golden and bubbly than fresh mozzarella. Delicious.</li>
        <li>Jarred or homemade roasted red peppers are perfect on pizza and offer extra flavor. Or, you could use thin two-inch long strips of fresh bell pepper, if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Jarred marinated or canned artichoke is an easy addition here. I sliced my jarred quartered artichokes in half again to make bite-sized wedges.</li>
        <li>Halved Kalamata olives develop condensed, intense flavor in the oven.</li>
        <li>Crumbled feta offers some extra creaminess and tanginess. It’s truly irresistible.</li>
        <li>Simply enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
